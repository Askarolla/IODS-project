Our newly created dataset comprises of 166 observations, having 7 variables for each. We have a two factor variable for __gender__ (M/F). There are then variables containing age, attitude and points. The last group of variables portraing the approach of each individual; deep, strategic and surface respectively. The latter variables are either integer or numeric.
Most of the individuals are female (110:56). Majority of people in the dataset is in their early twenties, female participants being on average a little younger. Interesting is, that while males have in general higher attitude score, females score better in the approach variables.The test scores were similar for both sexes though, male median being approximately 1 higher. At the same time, male IQR is higher as well (by 1.25)
